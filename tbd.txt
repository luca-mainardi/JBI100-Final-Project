- create the dataset:
i’m not good at manipulating data frames so it would take a lot of time to me
but if you are familiar with that probably a couple of hours

- create the player card:
it should be quite easy since it’s only made of text components, I would say 2 hours

- implement all the callbacks:
this is the hard part, most of them should be easy
but I do think know how to do the interaction between swarm and parallel so it could take more time.
Also the selection with highlighting in charts could be not easy.
So it’s better to not start the last days cause I don’t know how much time it takes
